In this project, I have used several Machine Learning and optimization techniques to predict the diabetic patients using Age, BMI, and BloodPressure. 

The complete project can be summarized as follows:
  1. Import the dataset.
  2. Understand the dataset.
  3. Perform Exploratory Data Anaysis.
  4. Applied several ML techniques.
